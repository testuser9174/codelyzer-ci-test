description: Disallows usage of the `inputs` metadata property.
descriptionDetails: 'See more at https://angular.io/styleguide#style-05-12.'
options: null
optionsDescription: Not configurable.
rationale: |-

  * It is easier and more readable to identify which properties in a class
  are inputs.
  * If you ever need to rename the property associated
  with @Input, you can modify it in a single place.
  * The metadata declaration attached to the directive is shorter and thus more readable.
