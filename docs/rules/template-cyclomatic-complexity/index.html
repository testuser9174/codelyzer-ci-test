  Checks cyclomatic complexity against a specified limit. It is a quantitative measure of the number of linearly independent paths through a
  program's source code
optionExamples:
  - 'true'
  - '[true, 6]'
options:
  items:
    type: string
  maxLength: 1
  minLength: 0
  type: array
optionsDescription: Determine the maximum number of the cyclomatic complexity.
rationale: Cyclomatic complexity over some threshold indicates that the logic should be moved outside the template.
