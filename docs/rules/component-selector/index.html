optionExamples:

  - '[true, "element", ["ng", "ngx"], "kebab-case"]'
  - '[true, "attribute", "myPrefix", "camelCase"]'
  - '[true, ["element", "attribute"], "myPrefix", "camelCase"]'

    - enum:
        - attribute
        - element

        - items:
            type: string
          type: array
        - type: string
    - enum:
        - camelCase
        - kebab-case
  maxLength: 3
  minLength: 3
  type: array
optionsDescription: |-

  Options accept three obligatory items as an array:
  1. `element` or `attribute` forces components to be used as either elements, attributes, or both (not recommended)
  2. A single prefix (string) or array of prefixes (strings) which have to be used in component selectors.
  3. `kebab-case` or `camelCase` allows you to pick a case.
      
rationale: |-

  * Consistent conventions make it easy to quickly identify and reference assets of different types.
  * Makes it easier to promote and share the component in other apps.
  * Components are easy to identify in the DOM.
  * Keeps the element names consistent with the specification for Custom Elements.
  * Components have templates containing HTML and optional Angular template syntax.
  * They display content. Developers place components on the page as they would native HTML elements and WebComponents.
  * It is easier to recognize that a symbol is a component by looking at the template's HTML.
