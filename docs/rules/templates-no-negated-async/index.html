description: Ensures that strict equality is used when evaluating negations on async pipe output.
options: null
optionsDescription: Not configurable.
rationale: >

  Angular's async pipes emit null initially, prior to the observable emitting any values, or the promise resolving. This can cause
  negations, like

  *ngIf="!(myConditional | async)" to thrash the layout and cause expensive side-effects like firing off XHR requests for a component which
  should not be shown.
